# Unscented Kalman Filter
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

This project contains implementation of Unscented Kalman Filter. Project assumptions are the same as at Extended Kalman Filter.

# Project informations

Input data consisting:
+ Laser measurements - given as x and y positions
+ Radar measurements - radius, angle, and radial velocity

# Example output
![Finished run][screen]

+ Red circles - lidar measurements.
+ Blue circles - radar measurements
+ Green markers - car's position estimated by implemented KalmanFilter. RMSE values fit to project requirements.

Using Unscented Kalman Filter decrease RMSE.
